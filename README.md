# My-Internet-Store

## Description

This application allows the user to view products, tags and categories on an online store. The user is also able to create a new product, tag or category, edit an existing product, tag or category, and delete any existing product, tag or category. This project allowed me to become familiar with the use of modularization, routing, dotenv to hide sensitive information, one-many and many-many concepts, extending models, and sequalize.

## Credits

I referenced many classroom activities to familiarize myself with the use of modularization, routing, dotenv to hide sensitive information, one-many and many-many concepts, extending models, and sequalize. I also utilized the web to look up resources regarding routing and modeling.
